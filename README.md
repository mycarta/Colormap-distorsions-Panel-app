## Colormap distorsions Panel app ##

The notebook in this repo served two goals:

1. It was a playground for practicing Panel (as additional exercise after the  PyData Austin 2019 tutorial by James Bednar,  [Panel: Dashboards for PyData](https://youtu.be/AXpjbJUVeb4))
2. It is a working app I wanted ot share to demonstrate the negative effect of non-perceptual colormaps on geophysical data

The app will be presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/).
